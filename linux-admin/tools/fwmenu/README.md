# Firewalld Interactive Menu (`fwmenu`)

`fwmenu` is an interactive command-line utility that simplifies managing \`firewalld\` on RHEL-based systems.  
It groups firewall operations into clear categories that a Linux administrator would use in daily work:

- Status & information  
- Zones & interfaces  
- Services & ports  
- Rich rules (advanced policy)  
- Security & hardening  
- NAT / masquerading  

This tool is part of the **Linux-Cloud-Security-Mastery → linux-admin → tools** collection.
