## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on work across Linux system administration, cloud engineering, DevOps, and security.  
It includes:

- Real troubleshooting cases  
- Polished, reproducible configurations  
- Automation workflows  
- Cloud infrastructure labs  
- Security investigations  
- Notes and mini-projects showing attention to detail and technical curiosity

Everything in this repository is the result of real systems I installed, broke, repaired, or optimized.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This repo is intentionally **skills-oriented**, not theory-oriented.

I build, break, and repair systems intentionally to learn:

- How Linux behaves under stress  
- What common mistakes look like  
- How real-world engineers solve problems  
- How cloud and security tools interact with OS layers  

This is the kind of knowledge hiring managers want to see in junior–mid Linux/Cloud/Security roles.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Develop mastery through hands-on experience  
- Build a professional, public portfolio of work  
- Demonstrate skill progression and technical depth  
- Document repeatable procedures  
- Create a personal “knowledge base” for future work  
- Show attention to detail — essential for Linux, cloud, and security roles
