# Linux • Cloud • Security Mastery

This repository documents practical, hands-on work across Linux administration, automation, cloud technologies, and security fundamentals. Every section is built from real troubleshooting, real configuration tasks, and repeatable workflows that strengthen system understanding over time.

---

## Philosophy

This repository is guided by deliberate practice. The focus is not on collecting commands, but on understanding how systems behave, why issues occur, and how to solve them in a consistent, reliable way.

The work captured here emphasizes:

- Methodical investigation  
- Clear, repeatable documentation  
- Root-cause analysis  
- Accurate system behavior understanding  
- Building long-term technical habits through real work  

The goal is to create a solid foundation that supports deeper growth in Linux, cloud, automation, and security engineering.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized by practical skill areas and real configuration scenarios.

### **1. Linux Administration (`linux-admin/`)**
Configurations, fixes, and workflows related to Linux system maintenance and operations.

Includes:
- Shell scripting
- Bash configuration
- Package and service management
- Filesystem work
- Core OS behaviors

---

### **2. Cloud (`cloud/`)**
Cloud-focused exercises and notes.  
Covers:
- Cloud CLI configuration
- Authentication & keys
- Service behavior and troubleshooting
- Small cloud automation tasks

---

### **3. Automation (`automation/`)**
Hands-on automation using Bash, Python, Ansible, and other tooling.

Focus areas:
- Repeatable configuration patterns
- Script and playbook structure
- Task automation fundamentals

---

### **4. Security (`security/`)**
Security fundamentals approached through practical exercises.

Includes:
- Basic scanning
- Key management
- System behavior analysis
- Secure configuration habits

---

### **5. Desktop Environment Fixes (`desktop-environment/`)**
Small but meaningful fixes that come from real system troubleshooting.

Examples:
- Brave launcher icon correction on RHEL
- Tilix VTE integration cleanup
- Environment configuration issues

These reflect attention to detail and precise system correction.

---

### **6. Attention to Detail (`attention-to-detail/`)**
A dedicated log of small, targeted fixes and investigations.

This captures:
- Unexpected behavior
- Missing icons, warnings, configuration quirks
- Steps taken to identify and resolve issues

These entries highlight consistent habits around documentation, understanding root causes, and improving system clarity.

## How to Use This Repository

This repo is meant to be **worked through**, not skimmed.

Recommended approach:

1. Navigate by skill area (Linux, Cloud, Automation, Security).  
2. Reproduce the steps from each fix or configuration.  
3. Use the troubleshooting entries to strengthen investigative habits.  
4. Expand the areas as your environment and projects evolve.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The repository will continue to grow as more topics are explored, including:

- Containers & orchestration
- Advanced automation patterns
- Cloud security tooling
- Linux hardening and monitoring
- DFIR-style investigations
- Complex network and service diagnostics

Each addition will follow the same practice-oriented philosophy:
understand the system, document the process, refine the solution.
